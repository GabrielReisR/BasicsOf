## Basics of [Python](https://github.com/GabrielReisR/BasicsOf/tree/master/Python) and [R](https://github.com/GabrielReisR/BasicsOf/tree/master/R) for future works
### A repository to centralize coding learning and information for these languages

  - Sampling and describing centrality
    - Python:[ _Randomly sampling *n* cases from a data frame and analysing their centrality measures_](https://github.com/GabrielReisR/BasicsOf/blob/master/Python/Amostragem%20e%20medidas%20de%20centralidade.py)
    - R: [_Randomly sampling *n* cases from a data frame and analysing their centrality measures_](https://github.com/GabrielReisR/BasicsOf/blob/master/R/sampling_centrality.R)
  - Correlation
    - R: [_Association between test score, time spent studying for the test and test anxiety_](https://github.com/GabrielReisR/BasicsOf/blob/master/R/correlation.R)
  - Simple regression
    - R: [_How many album sales are expected with the increase of $1000 on advertising?_](https://github.com/GabrielReisR/BasicsOf/blob/master/R/regression.R)
  - Multiple regression 
    - R: [_Predicting album sales based on (1) money spent on advertising, (2) attractiveness of band's members and (3) commercial airplay of songs_](https://github.com/GabrielReisR/BasicsOf/blob/master/R/multiple_regression.R)
